    "2. `cd <galapagos_dir>`\n",
    "3. `source build.sh` <br/> This sets up the environment variables needed to run the code within the tutorial\n",
    "4.  `galapagos-update-board adm-8k5-debug` <br/>\n",
    "5. `make hlsmiddleware` <br/> This makes all the IPs needed to connect boards.\n",
    "6. Repeat steps 4, 5 for all other boards you wish to support.\n",
    "7. `git clone https://github.com/tarafdar/HCAL_HLS4ML` <br/> This is an example project from the HLS4ML project. We will use this kernel within our example"
